## About Me
I am a computer science major and a pre-medical studentâ€”kind of a weird combination.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my senior year, studying for my MCAT, and getting in volunteer and research hours.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development in school, and biochemistry on the side.
 
## Projects
[Planify](https://github.com/kaphelps33/Planify)

This project allows students to plan their schedules and ensure that they can comfortably walk between classes.

## Goals and Objectives
- **Short-term:** Finish out my senior year on a high note and get a 515+ on my MCAT!
- **Long-term:** Attend Duke for medical school and help the world be a better place!
